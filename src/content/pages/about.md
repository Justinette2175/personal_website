I am a versatile full-stack web developer with a trackrecord building web applications for the education, IT, cryptocurrency, and pharmaceutical industries. A quick thinker and avid learner, I onboard efficiently - and proactively learn any necessary technologies - to be swiftly operational on client projects.
As a freelance contractor, I can, for example:

- Methodically refactor large scale applications that
  suffered from poor planning and inconsistency;
- Rapidly build prototypes and small scale applications as
  a one-person team;
- Lend an extra hand to overstretched development
  teams in crunch period;
- Build reusable component libraries to accelerate future
  development;
- Generate concise functional requirements and technical
  specifications for fast-growing apps that lack clear
  documentation.

In the past, I have worked in communications, graphic
and UX design, product ownership, and project
management. From having explored the spectrum of work
that goes into creating user-centric products, I empathize
with clients and adapt development to their business needs.

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Then we'll go with that data file! **I've been there.** _My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants._ What am I, the pope?

Daddy Bender, we're hungry. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! We're rescuing ya. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! I never loved you. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

1. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.
2. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."
3. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!
